# Traffic-Accident-Severity
by Deric Williamson

## Introduction/Business Case
For the Chicago Department of Transportation, as a data scientist, my job is to go over the city’s traffic accident reports and create a model that will predict the worst incidences. In doing so, I will find some underlying causes and possible advice for the city.   

For the Chicago Department of Transportation, this data will help reduce the number of traffic accidents that result in injury.

Drivers will always be distracted while driving, so what can we do to help reduce injury in accidents?


## The Data
The data was taken from cityofchicago.org/transportation and was created from the city of Chicago’s electronic crash reporting system from 2015 to present. 

There were three different datasets that I derived information from. The datasets were about the people, the vehicles, and the specific crashes involved which I combined into one dataset for this project.   
The data was used to predict whether an accident resulted in an injury or not, as shown by the graph. This shows that the data was imbalanced at 24 percent resulting in some type of injury.
